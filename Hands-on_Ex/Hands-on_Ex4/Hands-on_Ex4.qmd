editor: visual
---

## Overview

**Geographically weighted regression (GWR)** is a spatial statistical technique that takes non-stationary variables into consideration (e.g., climate; demographic factors; physical environment characteristics) and models the local relationships between these independent variables and an outcome of interest (also known as dependent variable). In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to build [hedonic pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedonicpricing.asp) models by using GWR methods. The dependent variable is the resale prices of condominium in 2015. The independent variables are divided into either structural and locational.

## The Data

Two data sets will be used in this model building exercise, they are:

-   URA Master Plan subzone boundary in shapefile format (i.e. *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*)

-   condo_resale_2015 in csv format (i.e. *condo_resale_2015.csv*)

## Getting Started

Before we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.

The R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:

-   R package for building OLS and performing diagnostics tests

    -   [**olsrr**](https://olsrr.rsquaredacademy.com/)

-   R package for calibrating geographical weighted family of models

    -   [**GWmodel**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/)

-   R package for multivariate data visualisation and analysis

    -   [**corrplot**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html)

-   Spatial data handling

    -   **sf**

-   Attribute data handling

    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**

-   Choropleth mapping

    -   **tmap**

The code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(olsrr, corrplot, ggpubr, sf, spdep, GWmodel, tmap, tidyverse, gtsummary)
```

## A Note about GWmodel

[GWmodel](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v063i17) package provides a collection of localised spatial statistical methods, namely: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW discriminant analysis and various forms of GW regression; some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms. Commonly, outputs or parameters of the GWmodel are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool, which can often precede (and direct) a more traditional or sophisticated statistical analysis.

## Geospatial Data Wrangling

### Importing geospatial data

The geospatial data used in this hands-on exercise is called MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL. It is in ESRI shapefile format. The shapefile consists of URA Master Plan 2014\'s planning subzone boundaries. Polygon features are used to represent these geographic boundaries. The GIS data is in svy21 projected coordinates systems.

The code chunk below is used to import *MP_SUBZONE_WEB_PL* shapefile by using `st_read()` of **sf** packages.

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

The report above shows that the R object used to contain the imported MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile is called *mpsz* and it is a simple feature object. The geometry type is *multipolygon*. it is also important to note that mpsz simple feature object does not have EPSG information.

### Updating CRS information

The code chunk below updates the newly imported *mpsz* with the correct ESPG code (i.e. 3414)

```{r}
mpsz_svy21 <- st_transform(mpsz, 3414)
```

After transforming the projection metadata, you can varify the projection of the newly transformed *mpsz_svy21* by using `st_crs()` of **sf** package.

The code chunk below will be used to varify the newly transformed *mpsz_svy21*.

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz_svy21)
```

Notice that the EPSG: is indicated as *3414* now.

Next, you will reveal the extent of *mpsz_svy21* by using `st_bbox()` of sf package.

```{r}
st_bbox(mpsz_svy21) #view extent
```

## Aspatial Data Wrangling

### Importing the aspatial data

The *condo_resale_2015* is in csv file format. The codes chunk below uses `read_csv()` function of **readr** package to import *condo_resale_2015* into R as a tibble data frame called *condo_resale*.

```{r}
condo_resale = read_csv("data/aspatial/Condo_resale_2015.csv")
```

After importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.

The codes chunks below uses `glimpse()` to display the data structure of will do the job.

```{r}
glimpse(condo_resale)
```

```{r}
head(condo_resale$LONGITUDE) #see the data in XCOORD column
```

```{r}
head(condo_resale$LATITUDE) #see the data in YCOORD column
```

Next, `summary()` of base R is used to display the summary statistics of *cond_resale* tibble data frame.

```{r}
summary(condo_resale)
```

### Converting aspatial data frame into a sf object

Currently, the *condo_resale* tibble data frame is aspatial. We will convert it to a **sf** object. The code chunk below converts condo_resale data frame into a simple feature data frame by using `st_as_sf()` of **sf** packages.

```{r}
condo_resale.sf <- st_as_sf(condo_resale,
                            coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"),
                            crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs=3414)
```

Notice that `st_transform()` of **sf** package is used to convert the coordinates from wgs84 (i.e. crs:4326) to svy21 (i.e. crs=3414).

Next, `head()` is used to list the content of *condo_resale.sf* object.

```{r}
head(condo_resale.sf)
```

Notice that the output is in point feature data frame.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the section, you will learn how to use statistical graphics functions of **ggplot2** package to perform EDA.

### EDA using statistical graphics

We can plot the distribution of *SELLING_PRICE* by using appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")
```

The figure above reveals a right skewed distribution. This means that more condominium units were transacted at relative lower prices.

Statistically, the skewed dsitribution can be normalised by using log transformation. The code chunk below is used to derive a new variable called *LOG_SELLING_PRICE* by using a log transformation on the variable *SELLING_PRICE*. It is performed using `mutate()` of **dplyr** package.

```{r}
condo_resale.sf <- condo_resale.sf %>%
  mutate(`LOG_SELLING_PRICE` = log(SELLING_PRICE))
```

Now, you can plot the *LOG_SELLING_PRICE* using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`LOG_SELLING_PRICE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")
```

Notice that the distribution is relatively less skewed after the transformation.

### Multiple Histogram Plots distribution of variables

In this section, you will learn how to draw a small multiple histograms (also known as trellis plot) by using `ggarrange()` of [**ggpubr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/) package.

The code chunk below is used to create 12 histograms. Then, `ggarrange()` is used to organised these histogram into a 3 columns by 4 rows small multiple plot.

```{r}
AREA_SQM <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AREA_SQM`)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

AGE <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AGE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_CBD <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CBD`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_CHILDCARE <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CHILDCARE`)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_ELDERLYCARE <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_ELDERLYCARE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, 
                               aes(x= `PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_HAWKER_MARKET <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_HAWKER_MARKET`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_KINDERGARTEN <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_KINDERGARTEN`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_MRT <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_MRT`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_PARK <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PARK`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_PRIMARY_SCH <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, 
                               aes(x= `PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

ggarrange(AREA_SQM, AGE, PROX_CBD, PROX_CHILDCARE, PROX_ELDERLYCARE, 
          PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA, PROX_HAWKER_MARKET, PROX_KINDERGARTEN, PROX_MRT,
          PROX_PARK, PROX_PRIMARY_SCH, PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH,  
          ncol = 3, nrow = 4)
```
